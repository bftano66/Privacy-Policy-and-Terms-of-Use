Our Intellectual Property
All copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, other intellectual property and materials, including page headers, images, text, illustrations, formats, logos, designs, icons, photographs, programs, music clips or downloads, video clips, and written and other materials (collectively, the “IP”) are owned, controlled or licensed by us, one of our affiliates, or by third parties who have licensed their materials to us and are protected by U.S. and international patent, trademark, copyright, and other intellectual property laws. You may access, view, download, and print the IP and all other materials displayed on the Sites for your personal, non-commercial use only; provided, however, that you (1) retain all copyright, trademark or other proprietary designations contained on all IP; (2) do not modify or alter the IP in any way; and (3) do not provide or make available the IP to any third party in a commercial manner. No license, right, title, or interest in any materials or software is transferred to you as a result of your use of the Sites or your accessing, viewing, downloading, or printing of the IP. You may not reproduce (except as noted above), publish, transmit, distribute, display, modify, create derivative works from, sell or participate in any sale of, or exploit in any way, in whole or in part, any of the IP, the Sites, or any related software. The IP on the Sites may be used only as a communication resource. Any other use, including the reproduction, modification, distribution, transmission, republication, display, or performance, of the IP on this Site is strictly prohibited. The compilation (meaning the collection, arrangement, and assembly) of all IP on the Sites is our exclusive property and is also protected by U.S. and international copyright laws.

Any and all of our names and logos, and all other graphics, logos, page headers, button icons, scripts, and service names included in or made available through any of the Sites are our exclusive trademarks and/or trade dress. All other marks are the property of their respective companies. All rights are reserved in all intellectual property owned or licensed by us.

No Reverse Engineering
You agree not to reverse engineer, hack, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, techniques, operations, algorithms, or other information from the Sites or Services (collectively, “Reverse Engineering”) or permit or induce such Reverse Engineering. If directly applicable law prohibits enforcement of the foregoing, you may engage in Reverse Engineering solely for purposes of obtaining such information as is necessary to achieve interoperability of independently created software with the Sites or Services, or as otherwise and to the limited extent permitted by directly applicable law, but only if: (a) Reverse Engineering is STRICTLY necessary to obtain such information; and (b) you have first requested such information from us and we are unable to satisfy the request and make such information available (for a fee or otherwise) under reasonable terms and conditions.

Any information supplied to or obtained by you under this section must be treated as our proprietary and confidential information, as provided throughout this Agreement, and whereby you are not permitted to disclose such confidential information without our express written permission. If we grant such request to provide the confidential information, and thereby remove the need for Reverse Engineering, the disclosed confidential information may only be used by you for the purpose described in this section, and such information must not be disclosed to any third party or used to create any software which is substantially similar to the Sites, Services associated with the Sites, or other platforms and services provided by us, beyond the scope of the request granted by us.

Services “AS IS”
We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can’t guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE, ALONG WITH ANY AFFILIATES, VENDORS, SUPPLIERS AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS”. WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Limitation of Liability
WE DO NOT EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO— In no event will Blueprint be liable to you for indirect, general, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary or other damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, business interruption, corruption of files, loss of business information or any other pecuniary loss). No oral or written information or advice given by Blueprint or others will create a warranty and neither you nor any third-party may rely on any such information or advice. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions and limitations may or may not apply to you. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN’T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.

THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE OR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY WHETHER RELATED TO OR ARISING FROM THE SITES, SERVICES, CONTENT, USES THEREOF, OR OF ANY SITE OR RESOURCE LINKED TO, REFERENCED, OR ACCESSED THROUGH THE SITES.

Resolving Disputes
Dispute Resolution. Before filing a claim against us, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us at Blueprint HCRE, Attn: Legal Department, 191 N. Wacker Drive, Suite 1680, Chicago, Illinois 60606. If a dispute is not resolved within 60 days of submission, you may bring a formal proceeding.

Judicial forum for disputes. This agreement will be governed by the laws of the state of Illinois.

Entire Agreement
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third-party beneficiary rights.

Waiver, Severability & Assignment
Any failure on our part to enforce a provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. We may assign our rights to any of our affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

Modifications
We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:

(a) changes to the law,

(b) new regulatory requirements, or
